-- DX Modernization Fixes 2 --

So I am not the creator of this original package. I am just a fan of it.


Changes Since:

* Added higher FOV range
	- From 110 to 120 (may also allow the minimum to be 75)
	- Default FOV is now 90

* Fixed the widescreen cinematic subtitles
	- Cutscenes did not show subtitles when resolution was in widescreen. Now they do
	- Used Kenties method of fixing the subtitles



INSTALLATION IS THE SAME!
