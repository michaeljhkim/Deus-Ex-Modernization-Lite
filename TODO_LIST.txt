- Try cutting the cutscene box width to make it 16:9 in widescreen, rather than just cutting the height
    and see if it looks good. It does on aspect ratios that are less than 16:9 (1440 x 960)

- Try and make it so that the cutscene box does not occur at all if subtitles are not available.
	Do an "or" check and see if subtitles are being played. If not, then continue with the original cutscene box code
